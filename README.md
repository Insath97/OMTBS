# Online Movie Ticket Booking System

## Overview

As part of my final year project, I independently developed an Online Movie Ticket Booking System using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Bootstrap 5 framework. The project involved creating a comprehensive platform with user registration and login functionalities, displaying a dynamic movie listing, providing detailed movie information, enabling showtime selection, seat reservation, and integrating a secure payment gateway. The system generated booking confirmations, allowed users to view their booking history, and offered an admin panel for theater management.

- **Dynamic Movie Listing**: Displays currently showing and upcoming movies with detailed information.
- **Showtime Selection**: Users can select showtimes for their preferred movies.
